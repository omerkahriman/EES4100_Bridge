EES4100_Bridge Project

This project has been developed as part of the assessment for an undergraduate course in Victoria University.

This application connects to a Modbus server and the reads the registers.
It also connects to a BACnet client where it reads the client requests and if the request matches the device ID and the instance number then it will remove the ModBus data from the head of the linked list and reply to the client with the data.
